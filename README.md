# 🏀 Basketball Tracking & Analytics – Computer Vision Project

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to build a full computer-vision pipeline capable of tracking players and the basketball during a game, analyzing team behavior, and generating useful visual analytics such as density maps and shot detection.  
The system focuses first on **single-camera static recordings**, and later extends to **multi-camera and broadcast-style footage**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect players, the ball, and the basketball hoop in video frames.
- Track all players across time and assign consistent IDs.
- Identify team membership using visual appearance (e.g., jersey colors).
- Track the ball trajectory and detect important events (e.g., made baskets).
- Generate court-level analytics such as density maps and movement heatmaps.
- Prepare the pipeline for extension to multi-camera datasets.

### Environment Setup

Install all required dependencies using:
→ pip install -r requirements.txt

### Dataset & Assets Preparation

source/vid9.mp4
→ Input broadcast basketball video used for evaluation.
basketball_court.png
→ Top-down basketball court template used for projection.
calib.png
→ Frame used for manual calibration and homography estimation.


### Possible Future Improvements **
Potential enhancements include:

- Multi-camera fusion and 3D player localization  
- Pose estimation for advanced player behavior analysis  
- Automated identification of passes, rebounds, screens, and other actions  
- Real-time processing for live analytics
